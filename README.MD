# Todo Management with Timer

## Overview

The **Todo Management with Timer** application is designed to help users stay focused and on track with their tasks. It features a timer that automatically starts at the scheduled time and a popup window that stays on top of other applications, ensuring that your task progress is always visible, and you never miss an important deadline. The application is perfect for productivity enthusiasts and anyone looking to stay organized.

## Features

- **Always on Top**: The progress popup window remains on top of all other windows, helping you stay focused on your task.
- **Automatic Task Start**: Tasks automatically begin at the scheduled time, so you don't have to worry about manually starting them.
- **Progress Tracking**: A visual progress bar shows how much time is left for each task.
- **Extract Task View**: You can extract the progress bar into a separate, frameless window that is draggable and resizable, providing flexibility in how you manage your tasks.
- **Remaining Time Display**: The time left for the task is displayed to keep you informed about deadlines.
- **Undo Extract**: If the progress bar is extracted into a separate window, you can easily undo it to return the progress bar to its original window.
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can switch between light and dark themes, making the interface easy on your eyes.

## How It Works

1. **Task Scheduling**: You set a start and end time for each task. The app will wait for the system time to match the start time before automatically starting the task timer.
2. **Popup Display**: When the task starts, a popup window appears, showing the task's name and a progress bar. The popup stays on top of other applications.
3. **Extract Progress**: If you need to focus on the task window more, you can extract the progress bar into a separate window. This extracted window has no borders, is resizable, and shows the task name and time remaining.
4. **Undo Extract**: You can undo the extraction of the progress bar, returning it to its original window.
5. **Focus and Productivity**: The app helps keep you focused by keeping your task progress visible at all times, reminding you of the ongoing task and time left.
